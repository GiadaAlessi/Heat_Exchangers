# Exercise 01 - Heat Exchanger Design

This project presents the design and optimization of an **air-to-water heat exchanger** using Python for numerical analysis and the **Œµ-NTU method** for heat transfer evaluation.

## üîç Project Overview
The project explores:
- **Heat transfer evaluation** using the Œµ-NTU method.
- **Reynolds number** and **Nusselt number** calculations for both air and water sides.
- Implementation of **extended surfaces (fins)** to improve heat exchanger performance.
- Evaluation of **pressure drop** and **optimization strategies** using the Pareto front to balance heat transfer and pressure loss.

## üêç Python Code
The Python code implements:
- Calculation of heat exchanger outlet temperatures.
- Estimation of thermal resistance and heat transfer coefficients.
- Optimization routine for improved performance.
- Thermophysical properties for air and water evaluated using the **CoolProp** library to ensure accurate fluid property calculations.
