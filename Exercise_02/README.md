# Exercise 02 - Heat Exchanger Experimental Analysis

This project presents an **experimental analysis** and **semi-analytical modeling** of a **counterflow heat exchanger** under various steady-state conditions. The objective was to evaluate the heat exchanger's performance by combining real experimental data with theoretical calculations.

## üîç Project Overview
The project includes:
- **Experimental Data Analysis:** Real temperature and flow rate data collected from laboratory measurements.
- **Numerical Calculations:** Implementation of semi-analytical methods to predict:
  - Outlet temperatures for hot and cold fluids.
  - Heat exchange rates.
  - Pressure drops across the exchanger.
- **Heat Loss Analysis:** Distribution of heat losses along the heat exchanger is explored, identifying key inefficiency points.

## üêç Python Code
The Python code utilizes:
- `CoolProp` for calculating thermodynamic properties.
- `Matplotlib` for detailed result visualization.

The implemented code generates:
- **Temperature Profiles** for the different operational modes.
- **Heat Loss Diagrams** showing the distribution of energy losses.
